# Mern-Stack-Internship
This repository contains all the tasks and projects I completed during my 45-day Mern-Stack Web Development Internship with  @Codetech IT Solutions PVT. LTD.. The internship is designed to cover the full web development cycle â€“ from basic structure to responsive design, API integration, CRUD operations and interactive applications.
